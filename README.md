Spork is very much in the early stages of development, so please tread carefully, here be dragons and disorder.

### Installation

Using npm:

```
npm install spork-cli
```

---

### Building Spork

###### The Recommended Way:

Spork has its own cli-interface. To create a new project, just call `spork create [your-project-name] <path>` from the command line, i.e:

```
spork create myNewSpork projects/sporks/ 
```

If you do get stuck, you can always just call call for help, i.e:

```
spork --help
```

or you can call

```
spork [command] --help
```

for a more specfic help section about that particular command.

> 
##A note for Windows Users:
Spork uses bower to manage its dependencies. It will run a check to see if bower is installed and install it for you, but git needs to be set up properly on you machine.
Please ensure that this is done before running spork, as it will fail when you try to create a new project if git is not accessible from the command-line. For more info about bower's requirements, please see the [Bower Documentation](https://github.com/bower/bower#windows-users). You can also download Git for Windows manually [here](http://git-scm.org/).

###### Building it Manually:

Simply clone the repo and run the build script from your Terminal (OSX+ Linux Only)

```
git clone https://github.com/driannaude/spork
./build
```

>NOTE: You may have to change the file permissions to make the build file executable

Alternatively you can manually install everything with npm and bower:

```
npm install
bower install
```

### Serve Your Spork

The spork-cli has a wrapper for the grunt serve task, because typing the word `spork` is fun! 

To start serving your project simply use the spork-cli, i.e:

```
spork serve
```

Your default browser should automatically open a new tab and serve the project for you, with livereload to reload after any changes are made.

Or if you prefer the boring, old fashioned way:

```
grunt serve
```
